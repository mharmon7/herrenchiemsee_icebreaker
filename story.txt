1) Erik was heading to the Flughafen to find the best brot
2) He heard the best brots were in Berlin
3) However, all of the brots were sold out, so he went back to the Hauptstrasse.
4) So I went with my homies to the biergarten.
5) So we all hopped in the bmw and headed out.
6) Meanwhile, a hund wearing lederhose was lurking in the backseat.
7) Isaias ran into Erik and told him a story about how he accidentally bought Lederhose
8) Erik wasn't interested in Isaias story so he jumped into a Porsche.
9) But he drove off too fast and ran over a Mehlhase.
10) It was unfortunate that the Dirndel was much faster and it was too late for Erik to flee.
11) It was dark outside the air was thin, the smell was that of apples on a lone saturday. As Erik Flee he could hear the sound of the hunds looking for him. 
12) Then the welt bewerbsfaehig hund from Berlin exited the BMW.
13) By the grace of god, the smell of apples was freshly baked Apfelkuchen so Erik quickly grabbed one and threw it at the hunds as distraction.
14) This was well timed for the Hund, as Erik's Porsche crashed into the BMW before it was driven into the Ratskeller of a nearby building.
15) To his surprise, he found himself staring at a zombie Mehlhase!
16) Fortunately for Erik, he happened to have a Apfelkuchen to give as an offering to the zombie Mehlase!
